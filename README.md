# diabetes_prediction
**PROBLEM STATEMENT :**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 

**IMPORTED LIBRARIES:**

I have imported the libraries are pandas,numpy,matplotlib. 

**OBJECTIVES:**

I have 2 objectives in mind. The first is to analyze the data, and see if it is possible to gleam any further information from the data to determine correlation between parameters and diabetes. The second is to attempt to get the best accuracy score using various supervised learning machine learning algorithms. This means to find out which algorithm is able to best predict whether a Pima Indian has diabetes or not based on this dataset.

**CONCLUSION:**

By using LogisticRegression i have predicted that  patients has diabetes or not based on given dataset,and i got 76% accuracy score
